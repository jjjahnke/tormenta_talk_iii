# Rule: Generating a Task List from a PRD

*   [Back to Main Instructions](copilot-instructions.md) #file:copilot-instructions.md
*   [Related: Product Requirements Document (PRD) Generation](create-prd.md) #file:create-prd.md
*   [Related: Task Completion and Management](task-completion.md) #file:task-completion.md

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step task list in Markdown format based on an existing Product Requirements Document (PRD). The task list should provide a complete implementation roadmap for developers, with proper sequencing, dependencies, and quality checks.

## GitHub Copilot Integration

### Activation Triggers
This rule activates when:
- User mentions "tasks from PRD", "implementation plan", or "break down PRD"
- Working with files matching `prd-*.md` pattern
- User requests task generation or implementation planning
- File naming pattern `tasks-*.md` is detected

### Workspace Context
- **Project Structure Analysis:** Examine existing folders, naming conventions, and architecture patterns
- **Technology Stack Detection:** Identify frameworks, testing libraries, and build tools in use
- **Existing Task Files:** Reference other task files for consistency in format and detail level
- **Code Patterns:** Leverage existing code structure to suggest appropriate file paths and organization

## Prerequisites

Before generating tasks, ensure you have:
- Access to the specified PRD file and its complete content
- Understanding of the current project structure and technology stack
- Knowledge of existing development patterns and conventions in the workspace
- Ability to create/modify files in the `/tasks` directory

## Enhanced Analysis Process

### Phase 1: PRD Deep Analysis
1. **Extract Core Components:**
   - Identify all functional requirements (numbered list from PRD)
   - Map user stories to implementation needs
   - Note technical constraints and dependencies
   - Identify integration points with existing systems

2. **Categorize Feature Complexity:**
   - **Simple:** Basic CRUD operations, simple UI components
   - **Medium:** Complex business logic, multiple integrations
   - **Complex:** Advanced algorithms, performance optimization, security features

3. **Identify Implementation Layers:**
   - **Data Layer:** Database schemas, models, migrations
   - **API Layer:** Routes, controllers, middleware, validation
   - **Business Logic:** Services, utilities, algorithms
   - **UI Layer:** Components, pages, styling, interactions
   - **Integration Layer:** External APIs, authentication, notifications

### Phase 2: Task Categorization Strategy

**Setup & Infrastructure (S)**
- Database setup, migrations, configurations
- API route structure, middleware setup
- Authentication and authorization setup

**Core Features (C)**
- Primary functionality implementation
- Business logic and data processing
- Main user workflows

**User Interface (U)**
- Component development
- Page layouts and navigation
- User interactions and feedback

**Integration & External (I)**
- Third-party service integration
- Internal system connections
- Data synchronization

**Testing & Quality (T)**
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for workflows
- End-to-end testing scenarios

**Documentation & Deployment (D)**
- Code documentation
- User documentation updates
- Deployment configurations

## Process

1. **Receive PRD Reference:** User provides path to specific PRD file
2. **Analyze Project Context:** Scan workspace for existing patterns, tech stack, and conventions
3. **Deep PRD Analysis:** Extract all requirements, user stories, and technical considerations using the enhanced analysis process
4. **Generate Implementation Plan:** Create high-level categories and estimate complexity
5. **Phase 1: Generate Parent Tasks:** Create main task categories with complexity indicators and present to user
6. **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause for user to respond with "Go" or request modifications
7. **Phase 2: Generate Detailed Sub-Tasks:** Break down each parent task with specific, actionable items
8. **Generate File Structure:** Identify all files to be created/modified based on project patterns
9. **Add Quality Checks:** Include validation steps and acceptance criteria mapping
10. **Save Task List:** Create final document with complete implementation roadmap

## How to Invoke This Rule

Users can trigger this rule by typing:
- "Generate tasks from [PRD filename]"
- "Create implementation plan for [PRD filename]"
- "Break down [PRD filename] into development tasks"
- "Convert [PRD filename] to task list"

**File-based triggers:**
- Opening or referencing files with pattern `prd-*.md`
- Creating files with pattern `tasks-*.md`
- Working in `/tasks` directory with implementation planning

## Target Audience & AI-Human Collaboration

**Primary:** Junior to mid-level developers working with AI coding agents
**Secondary:** Project managers tracking progress and senior developers reviewing implementation approach

### Developer Skill Retention Strategy
This task generation explicitly distinguishes between:
- **üë®‚Äçüíª Human Developer Tasks:** Critical thinking, architecture decisions, complex problem-solving
- **ü§ñ AI Agent Tasks:** Boilerplate code, repetitive implementations, basic CRUD operations
- **ü§ù Collaborative Tasks:** Human designs/guides, AI implements, human reviews

### Skill Development Focus Areas
- **Architecture & Design:** Human-led system design and component planning
- **Problem Solving:** Complex business logic and edge case handling
- **Code Review:** Understanding and improving AI-generated code
- **Testing Strategy:** Designing test cases and validation approaches
- **Integration:** Connecting systems and handling real-world complexities

## Error Handling and Ambiguity Resolution

When encountering ambiguity, insufficient information, or conflicting requirements during the task generation process, the AI *must* follow these guidelines:

1.  **Prioritize Clarification:** Always ask clarifying questions to the user. Refer to the "Clarifying Questions Framework" in the related PRD rule (`create-prd.md`) for types of questions.
2.  **One Question at a Time:** Ask questions one at a time, allowing the user to respond fully before proceeding.
3.  **Identify Gaps:** Explicitly state what information is missing or what aspects are unclear regarding task breakdown or dependencies.
4.  **Propose Assumptions (if necessary):** If direct clarification is not immediately possible, propose reasonable assumptions about task scope or dependencies and explicitly state them to the user for confirmation.
5.  **Avoid Proceeding with Ambiguity:** Do not generate tasks based on assumptions without explicit or implicit user confirmation.
6.  **Conflict Resolution:** If conflicting task requirements or dependencies are identified, highlight the conflict to the user and ask for a definitive decision.
7.  **Fallback to High-Level:** If detailed information cannot be obtained, generate a high-level task list and clearly mark sections that require further detail or clarification from the user.
